The [Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)](https://sdgs.un.org/goals) are a set of 17 goals adopted by the United Nations General Assembly in 2015 to end poverty, protect the planet, and ensure prosperity for all. Each goal has specific targets to be achieved by 2030.

This hackathon is designed to foster innovation and creativity in addressing some of the most pressing global issues related to sustainable development. In our hackathon, we have chosen 5 research tracks based on the SDGs to tackle real-world challenges related to sustainable development. Participants will work in teams to develop solutions related to the following research tracks:

- **Clean water and sanitation** – addressing issues related to water quality and integrated water management (SDG #6)
- **Affordable clean energy** – developing innovative solutions to overcome energy deficiency and promote renewable energy (SDG #7)
- **Sustainable cities and infrastructure** – using GIS and remote sensing to detect and address challenges related to urban sprawl and urbanization (SDG #9 and SDG #11)
- **Climate action** – finding solutions to challenges related to urban flood, forest fire, wind speed, drought, ecology, and forest fragmentation (SDG #13)
- **Disaster management applications and land utilization/planning** – developing tools and strategies to improve disaster management and land utilization (SDG #15)

Participants are encouraged to leverage their diverse skills and knowledge to create cutting-edge solutions that can contribute to advancing the Sustainable Development Goals. We also encourage participants to network and collaborate with other teams to enhance their learning experience and create a lasting impact.

We wish you all the best of luck and look forward to seeing the innovative solutions that you will create during this hackathon!

## Join the GTSD Hackathon: A Roadmap to Participation

After the welcome talk, participants are confimed about the theme preference on which they will be working.

### Technology Session

A brief session on QGIS, GitHub, Google Earth Engine and GeoPython is conducted to assist participants in brainstorming and developing their ideas.

### Individual Work

Each team will work individually. Before Friday evening, each team should finalize 3 locations of interest and inform the moderators about their interest and plan to implement.

### Location Selection

From the proposed 3 locations, the moderator will select a location, which will be recorded. From that point, the team should build a solution for the chosen theme in that particular region of interest. Changing the location is not permitted once the decision is conveyed and recorded by the moderators. Therefore, teams are advised to check the data availability and other parameters before proposing the 3 locations to moderators.

### Technical Assistance

Moderators are available to provide any technical advice that may be required.

### Pulse Check

On Saturday morning at 11:00 AM, a pulse check will be conducted, and each team is expected to connect with their moderators to discuss their advancements.

### Submission

The submission deadline is Saturday evening at 6:00 PM. Apart from the pulse check, teams can reach out to moderators as and when required.
